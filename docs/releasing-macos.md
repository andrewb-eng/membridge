# Releasing the macOS installer

The `curl | sh` installer is pinned to one release (version + SHA-256). Every
release regenerates and republishes `install.sh`.

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` (and let `scripts/prepare-app.js` sync
   `app/package.json` on the next build).
2. Build the app — this runs `prepare-app.js` (which bundles `bin/` into the
   app) and produces `dist/MemBridge-<version>-arm64.zip`:
   ```sh
   npm run dist:mac
   ```
3. Stamp the pin into `scripts/install/install.sh`:
   ```sh
   node scripts/install/gen-install.js
   ```
   It prints the version + SHA-256 it embedded.
4. Create the GitHub release tagged `v<version>` and upload
   `dist/MemBridge-<version>-arm64.zip` as a release asset. The asset name must
   match `MemBridge-<version>-arm64.zip` (the installer builds the URL from it).
5. Publish `install.sh` so `https://membridge.me/install.sh` serves it: copy
   `scripts/install/install.sh` to the root of the `mmelika/membridge-site`
   repo as `install.sh`, commit, and push (GitHub Pages serves it). The raw
   fallback URL, which works without the site repo, is
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmelika/membridge/master/scripts/install/install.sh`.
6. Commit the regenerated `scripts/install/install.sh` in this repo.
7. Smoke-test on a clean Apple Silicon machine:
   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://membridge.me/install.sh | sh
   membridge --version
   ```
   Confirm zero Gatekeeper prompts on the app.
